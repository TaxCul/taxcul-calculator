## 🎯 Component Architecture

### Consistent Design Pattern
All tax calculator components follow the same optimized pattern:

```jsx
// InputField component defined OUTSIDE main component for performance
const InputField = ({ label, icon: Icon, value, onChange, placeholder }) => (
  // Consistent styling and behavior
)

const TaxCalculator = () => {
  // State management
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({...})
  const [results, setResults] = useState(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  // API integration
  const handleCalculate = async (e) => {
    // Standardized API call pattern
  }

  return (
    // Consistent layout structure
  )
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **InputField components** defined outside to prevent recreation
- ✅ **Efficient re-renders** with proper state management
- ✅ **Smooth animations** with Framer Motion
- ✅ **Optimized API calls** with error handling

## 🔧 API Integration

### Backend Requirements
The application expects a backend API with the following endpoints:

```
POST /calculate/individual-income-tax
POST /calculate/withholding/interest
POST /calculate/withholding/tenders
POST /calculate/agriculture
POST /calculate/insurance
POST /calculate/financial
POST /calculate/healthcare
```

### Request Payload
```json
{
  "value": 1000,
  "income": 5000,
  "exemptIncome": 500,
  "deductions": 200
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "taxDue": 750,
  "success": true
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with lime green accents
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions on buttons and cards
- **Loading States**: Animated spinners during calculations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Form Validation**: Real-time input validation

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive across all device sizes:

- **Desktop** (1024px+): 3-column layout with sidebar
- **Tablet** (768px - 1023px): Adapted grid layouts
- **Mobile** (< 768px): Single column stack layout

## 🔄 State Management

### Local State Pattern
Each calculator manages its own state independently:
- Form data inputs
- Calculation results
- Loading states
- Error messages

### State Structure
```javascript
{
  formData: {
    value: '',
    income: '',
    exemptIncome: '',
    deductions: ''
  },
  results: {
    taxDue: 0,
    taxableIncome: 0,
    effectiveRate: 0,
    netAmount: 0
  },
  loading: false,
  error: ''
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment

npm run build
npm start

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-production-api.com/api
